            <h2>About ReSmokle</h2>
            <p>At ReSmokle, we’re on a mission to transform how the vaping and smoking industries think about waste. Born out of a passion for sustainability and a frustration with the growing mountain of single-use packaging, ReSmokle offers a bold new solution: we collect, clean, and recycle used materials—giving them a second life as reusable products or raw materials for 3D printing. From our pipe-cleaning service to our plans for repurposed plastic goods, everything we do is rooted in environmental responsibility, innovation, and community impact. Headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, we’re proud to be the first to bring this kind of circular economy solution to our region—one item at a time.</p>

Let’s Reuse. Recycle. ReImagine… and rebuild a cleaner future, one piece at a time.</p>
            <h3>The Hidden Waste of Vaping and Smoking</h3>
            <p>The vaping and smoking industries generate a disproportionately large waste stream relative to the size of their products. A single vape cartridge weighs less than half an ounce, yet it's often sold in packaging that weighs up to ten times more—made from mixed materials like hard plastic, metal, rubber, and cardboard that are rarely recycled. With over 9 million adult e-cigarette users in the U.S. alone, this adds up to millions of pounds of non-biodegradable waste annually. Most of it ends up in landfills—or worse, in waterways and neighborhoods—because standard recycling systems aren't equipped to handle these specialized materials. This growing imbalance between product and packaging creates an urgent environmental and waste management issue, one that ReSmokle is determined to solve through targeted collection, responsible processing, and meaningful reuse.</p>
